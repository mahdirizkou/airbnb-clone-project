# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like ***Airbnb***. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Team Roles :

- **Backend Developer :** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack :

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Database Design : 

- **Users**
  - Fields: id, name, email, password, created_at
  - Description: A user can book properties, write reviews, and make payments.

- **Properties**
  - Fields: id, owner_id, title, description, price_per_night
  - Description: Each property belongs to a user (owner) and can have multiple bookings and reviews.

- **Bookings**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date
  - Description: A booking links a user to a property for a specific date range.

- **Reviews**
  - Fields: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment
  - Description: Users can leave reviews for properties they have booked.

- **Payments**
  - Fields: id, user_id, booking_id, amount, status
  - Description: Payments are tied to bookings and track the payment status.

**Entity Relationships**:
- A user can own multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- A property can have multiple bookings and reviews.
- A booking is connected to one user and one property.
- A payment is associated with one booking.

## Feature Breakdown :

- **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## API Security :
Ensuring the security of the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, maintain trust, and prevent malicious activities. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Verifies the identity of users accessing the system (e.g., using JWT or OAuth). This is essential to ensure that only registered users can access their accounts and perform authorized actions.

- **Authorization**  
  Determines what actions authenticated users are allowed to perform (e.g., role-based access control). This ensures that users can only access and modify resources they own, such as their bookings or properties.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Controls the number of requests a user or client can make in a given time period. This protects the API from abuse, such as denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or brute-force attempts.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization**  
  Checks and cleans user inputs to prevent common attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). This protects the integrity of the database and frontend.

- **HTTPS and Secure Data Transmission**  
  Encrypts all data sent between clients and servers. This is crucial to protect sensitive information like passwords and payment details from being intercepted.

**Why Security is Crucial:**
- Protecting user data (personal info, passwords, bookings)
- Securing financial transactions and payment details
- Preventing unauthorized access to user accounts and admin areas
- Maintaining the overall trust and reliability of the platform

## CI/CD Pipeline : 
Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code change 

**Tools we can use:** 

 **GitHub Actions** → Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying directly from the GitHub repository.
- **Docker** → Packages the application into containers for consistent deployment.
- **Jenkins** → Provides customizable pipelines for complex build and deployment processes.
